Many to One
===========

A many to one relationship associates many children with a single parent. For
example, a company can have many employees working in the same division (for
example engineering, legal, marketing, ...) but a particular employee can only
work in one division.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`many-to-one`
      OpenAlchemy documentation for many to one relationships.

   `SQLAlchemy Many to One <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/basic_relationships.html#many-to-one>`_
      SQLAlchemy documentation for many to one relationships.

The following example defines a many to one relationship between *Employee*
and *Division*:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/relationship/many_to_one/example-spec.yml
    :language: yaml
    :linenos:

The following file uses OpenAlchemy to generate the SQLAlchemy models:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/relationship/many_to_one/models.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

The SQLAlchemy models generated by OpenAlchemy are equivalent to the following
traditional models file:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/relationship/many_to_one/models_traditional.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

OpenAlchemy will generate the following typed models:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/relationship/many_to_one/models_auto.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

Nullable
--------

The OpenAPI *nullable* directive can be used to control the nullability of the
many to one relationship.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`many-to-one-nullable`
      OpenAlchemy documentation for the nullability of many to one
      relationships.

The following example defines a many to one relationship between *Employee* and
*Division* that is not nullable:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/relationship/many_to_one/not-nullable-example-spec.yml
    :language: yaml
    :linenos:

The following file uses OpenAlchemy to generate the SQLAlchemy models:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/relationship/many_to_one/not_nullable_models.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

The SQLAlchemy models generated by OpenAlchemy are equivalent to the following
traditional models file:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/relationship/many_to_one/not_nullable_models_traditional.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

OpenAlchemy will generate the following typed models:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/relationship/many_to_one/not_nullable_models_auto.py
    :language: python
